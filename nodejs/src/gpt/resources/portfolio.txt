This website "portfolio.vitmenu.com" is made for the chat feature which is intended to answer questions about me on behalf of the developer when the developer is not available, so that you can get to know me better in realtime, and I can get to know you better too. If you have any questions, please feel free to chat. Thank you.
This portfolio features a simple chat app functionality and includes a unique aspect where, if I (the main character of the website) am not available, an assistant can act on my behalf. If you have any questions, the assistant will answer based on the resume I have prepared.
It is planned to create a feature which analyses the content of user messages to understand their intentions and activate appropriate system actions. For instance, if a user's text message is related to scheduling, the AI will assist in creating the schedule, enabling more flexible interactions.

Additionally, the platform-type web service that he has been working on since he started web development has served as a roadmap, enabling him to acquire a lot of web development knowledge. I believe he will be able to complete this project before graduating from university and will grow into a remarkable developer.
